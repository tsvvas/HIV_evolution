	K-mer (China paper)!!!


	Questions:
1) morphological and metabolic features
2) clusters of orthologs
3) Since the latter represents the approach of one and
the same group using the same set of tools, it may provide a more
consistent background for comparison.
4) It is the difference between the actual counting result p and the
predicted value p0 that really reflects the shaping role of selective
evolution.
5) jackknife-type tests.
6) taxa
7) A search of the
101,602 protein sequences in SWISS-PROT database
Rel. 40 (2000) showed that all these proteins have
taken only less than 26% of the six-string types. If one
looks at individual prokaryote species, this contrast
appears to be even more remarkable: EcoliK has
taken less than 2% and Mycge less than 0.3% of the
six-string types.


	Important:
1) So far there are nowidely accepted ways to infer phylogenetic relationships from complete genome data.
2) Method = just counting
3) Markov model; p0
4) First, one may use the whole genome sequence. Second,
one may just collect the coding sequences in the genome. Third,
one makes use of the translated amino acid sequences from the
coding segments of DNA.
5) At the overall level, the division of life into the
three main domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya
is a clean and prominent feature. No mixing among
domains takes place on all trees for K ‡ 5.
6) is like SSU rRNA
7) Some species can at the K = 1, K = 2 be not devided in their specie but at K >= 5,6 
It almost certainly will.
